##Requirements
-------------------------------
+(25) Refactored pet application. Grader should be able to clone your project and execute it. Git log should reflect multiple commits.

+(20) Reasonable topic report. Note that, although this is a team project, it would be possible for team members to receive different scores (e.g., if one team member doesn't do a report, he or she loses the 20 points. A report that shows minimal effort may receive < 20 points.).

+(5) Post on piazza. No points if you don't include the team number.
